- `npm start` - Starts the development server and runs the app.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.

## File Descriptions
- `src/index.js`: The entry point of the app, where React is rendered into the DOM.
- `src/App.js`: The main component of the app that handles basic rendering and structure.
- `public/`: Contains the `index.html` file and other static resources.
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts for running and building the app.
